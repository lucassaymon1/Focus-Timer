# Focus Timer

A web app that provides you a pomodoro's like timer. In this application you can also activate different environment sounds which can make you more focused on what you're doing.

## Technologies and features

this app were developed using `html`, `css` and `javascript`, and uses concepts such as `es6 modules`, `web DOM manipulation`, `event listeners`, `dark mode` and `audios`. The timer has a counter set by default of 25 minutes, from where you can add or remove the timer counter by 5 minutes, as well as play and pause, by clicking in the buttons right below the timer. When the countdown hits zero, it will also trigger an alarm to signal the user that the counting is over. By clicking on the sound buttons, you can enable or disable the audio of each one of them, being able even to mix different environment sounds with different volumes ðŸ˜‰.
